# Capstone Project for foodpanda PowerUp! SG Tech Traineeship
## Description and Design Process
Our goal for this project is to develop a web application using React JS that will enable users to easily manage food subscription and create food playlists. By doing so, we aim to reduce the stress and inconvenience of deciding what to order for our users. To achieve this, we will create a user-friendly interface where users can easily select their food preferences and generate a playlist of food deliveries.
### Sample User Stories:

1. As a customer who is busy at the beginning of the week and do not have time to plan my lunches, I would appreciate a healthy meal being delivered to me every Monday at 1:00pm.
   
2. As a customer with peanut allergy, I would like to ensure that every food delivery in my customized food playlist is peanut-free.
      
3. As a customer who enjoys trying new restaurants, I would like the Food Playlist to show me the names of restaurants that specialize in my preferred cuisines and may be handling my food delivery.
   
4. As a customer who tends to be forgetful, I would like to receive a notification reminder for my next scheduled food delivery.
   
5. As a customer who is going to travel, I would like to temporarily pause my food playlist for a period of time.
